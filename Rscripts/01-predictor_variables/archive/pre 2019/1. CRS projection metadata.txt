EF projection metadata

The aim of the associated script is to have workable rasters of all EFs. Workable consists of changing the CRS to WGS_84 and cropping the global distributions of the rasters to something managable, basically around Australia. ('EFs cropped' deals with the exact extent + masking non-Australia values.)

The EFs are as follows:

(1-19) Bioclim variables
Reference: Fick, S.E. and R.J. Hijmans, 2017. Worldclim 2: New 1-km spatial resolution climate surfaces for global land areas. International Journal of Climatology,
Note: I think it is this reference (it's V2.0's one; these might be V1.4... pretty sure they're the new ones though. Not 100%, as yeah..)

(1) BIO1 = Annual Mean Temperature (MAT)
(2) BIO2 = Mean Diurnal Range (Mean of monthly (max temp - min temp)) (MDR)
(3) BIO3 = Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (* 100) (ISO)
(4) BIO4 = Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100) (TS)
(5) BIO5 = Max Temperature of Warmest Month (TWARMM)
(6) BIO6 = Min Temperature of Coldest Month (TCOLDM)
(7) BIO7 = Temperature Annual Range (BIO5-BIO6) (TAR)
(8) BIO8 = Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter (TWETQ)
(9) BIO9 = Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter (TDRYQ)
(10) BIO10 = Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter (TWARMQ)
(11) BIO11 = Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter (TCOLDQ)
(12) BIO12 = Annual Precipitation (AP) 
(13) BIO13 = Precipitation of Wettest Month (PWETM)
(14) BIO14 = Precipitation of Driest Month (PDRYM)
(15) BIO15 = Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation) (PS)
(16) BIO16 = Precipitation of Wettest Quarter (PWETQ)
(17) BIO17 = Precipitation of Driest Quarter (PDRYQ)
(18) BIO18 = Precipitation of Warmest Quarter (PWARMQ)
(19) BIO19 = Precipitation of Coldest Quarter (PCOLDQ)

(20) Australia population
What is it: Raw population statistics from Australian Government, 2011. 
Reference: http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1270.0.55.007Explanatory%20Notes12011?OpenDocument
Notes: Not very useful considering what other humna influence indexes I have (e.g. NASA's Human Influence Index). But it is here if need be. 


(21) Aridity (AP)
What is it: Global Aridity Index
Reference: Trabucco, A., and Zomer, R.J. 2009. Global Aridity Index (Global-Aridity) and Global Potential Evapo-Transpiration (Global-PET) Geospatial Database. CGIAR Consortium for Spatial Information. Published online, available from the CGIAR-CSI GeoPortal at: http://www.csi.cgiar.org.
Notes: see also Methods file (in CGIR CSI Aridity and Evaporation) for methods, equations and more references

(22) potential evapo-transpiration (EVAP)
What is it: potential evapotranspiration of a system
Reference:Trabucco, A., and Zomer, R.J. 2009. Global Aridity Index (Global-Aridity) and Global Potential Evapo-Transpiration (Global-PET) Geospatial Database. CGIAR Consortium for Spatial Information. Published online, available from the CGIAR-CSI GeoPortal at: http://www.csi.cgiar.org.

Notes:

(23) swhc
What is it: actually not sure; will come back to this, but hopefully not. Hopefully I have a better one as EF #16 :)

Notes:

(24) elevation (ELEV)
What is it: mean (or median, actually) elevation at 1km^2 for globe
Reference: Fischer, G., F. Nachtergaele, S. Prieler, H.T. van Velthuizen, L. Verelst, D. Wiberg, 2008. Global Agro-ecological Zones Assessment for Agriculture (GAEZ 2008). IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria and FAO, Rome, Italy
Notes: same source as swhc (above), but actually useful. http://www.fao.org/soils-portal/soil-survey/soil-maps-and-databases/harmonized-world-soil-database-v12/en/ has useful information/links

(25) topographic heterogeneity (TH)
Based off elevation, this is the measure of how bumpy a landscape is, defined as the SD of the mean for the scale. Actualy very easy to calculate; use aggregate( fun = sd), it was really quite surprising.
Reference: not sure; you'll have to google it. (Richard gave me this method, and didn't say who did it)


(26) Aus land use  
What is it: land use of Australia. Again, hope to get a better one (perhaps #17). So keep an eye out down there.
Reference: not sure; see NLUM_UserGuide_2010-11_v1.0.0.pdf for details

(29 a, b, c) Derived water-holdingg capacities (Webb et al. 2000)
What are they: 
a = potential storage of water derived from soil texture (mm)) (st)
b = potential storage of water in the root zone (mm) (rz)
c = potential storage of water in the soil profile (mm) (sp)

(30) Plant available water capacity
What is it: plant available water capacity of soils -- not gonna lie, kinda sounds like it might be like soil water holding capacity, but we'll see what they correlate as 
Scale of 250 m -- so have to square for 1 km2. Or not? Idk...
Reference: "The SoilAttribute_src datasets provide information on the source of the data and hence indicates quality of the individual soil attribute datasets. The values of the source datasets are as follow" 
Exact reference: not sure, you'll have to google it/refer to website: http://www.asris.csiro.au

(31) Plant-extractable water capacity
What is it: "the amount of water that can  be extracted from the soil to fulfill evapotranspiration demands. It is 
often assumed to be spatially invariant in large-scale computations of 
the soil-water balance. Empirical evidence, however, suggests that this 
assumption is incorrect. This data set provides an estimate of the 
global distribution of plant-extractable water capacity of soil."
