AVH paper 100 km SRE-EFs METADATA

Currently it's 22/11

Questions: how to get my 200 km to relate to 

I am going to stick my notes in here, so parsimoneous sake for the script. Or succinctness. Alors...

# Now that I have the data, what kinds of things do I want to change, given the prosepct of a scale-critiquing paper? ------------------------------
# (1) different scales, yup.
# (2) no, low and medium n/a values out
# (3) how different ichao1 vs. a relationships are
# cannot weight cells, cannot control for C3/4, this is really only checking the methods I have done so far
# did I do them? I haven't checked missing values etc. for AVH at different scales. Let's see 'em!  
  
# Model nomenclature------------------------------ 
AP: annual precipitation
Arid: aridity
CM: minimum temperature of the coldest month
CQ: Precipitation of the coldest quarter
Elev: elevation
Evap: potential evapotranspiration
HII: human influence index
MAT: mean annual temperature
PS: precipitation seasonality
RZ: potential storage of water in the root zone 
SP: potential storage of water in the soil profile 
ST: potential storage of water derived from soil texture
WM: maximum temperature of the warmest month
CQ: Precipitation of the warmest quarter


# avh; 
# 1, 5, 2 for scale; 
# a, b, c for EFs (a = all, b = redcued, c = anthropogenic only);
# na, vl, l, m for community status;  
# e.g. avh_1_a_vl
# looks a bit nasty; we'll see how this goes  

# EF correlation matrix -----------------------------------
# notes from correlations:
# can't do GLU (categorical varaible) & HII doesn't compute (?)

# Notes from book: 
# Ap ~ Aridity  ---> choose one [arid]
# CM ~ WQ (0.6 so i dunno what do just yet)
# PS might fit in there too?
# -> CQ + evap/MAT and not WQ or PS 
# MAT ~ evap
# RZ ~ SP = ST; so take RZ
# WM ~ MAT, evap & CQ, so perhaps ditch

# notes this the excel spreadsheet:
# MAt and WM correlated strongly with a few things each; best to drop em :) 
# AP or arid? Well, I say keep AP cos it's a more mechanistic response from teh plant's POV (no water = death)  
# and then we just have PS ~ CM, AP ~ WQ and SP ~ ST left. Cool.
