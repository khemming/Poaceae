POA Species richness x annual precipitation (AP)

Name codes
Poa species: 1383 species from Australian Virtual Herbarium (AVH) -- sourced from Richard.
AP (annual precipitation): bio_12 (@ 30s/1km^2 resolution) from WorldClim. Modified to extent of Australian continent.

Mostly a trial and error way to undertsand this process.

The aim of this process is to correlate POA species (all/native/introduced) with annual precipitation (AP; bio_12 from worldclim).
There are a variety of methods used. 

Firstly, I have developed an Australia-dimensions RASTER of the AP climate data. (And I am developing a stack of all of the environmental variables i intend to plot.)
This is a gridded, coordinated (lat/long) square, with Australian-shaped MAP data within those grids (at a ~1km^2 scale).

For this data, I have adjusted the resolution (AGGREGATE fuction) of the cells to adjust the data to a plottable scale. (Something like, 1km^2 -> 1,000km^2.)

To marry the POA data to the MAP data, I have used a RASTERISZE function. This adds the coordinates of individual species occurrences into the MAP RASTER.
(Within this, there is a code which turns the POA data from [species x occurrences] to unique species per grid, thus obtaining species richness per MAP RASTER cell.)

To account for differences in sampling effort from obtaining the species data, I did a CHOA ESTIMATE. I am not 100% on the 'how' this is achieved (both in terms of the equation in real -life, but also the R codes), however the 'why' is related to unequal sampling effort, which is very relevant. The estimate is included within the codes, sourced from "Richards poa script.R".

I have ended up with RICHNESS and AP data in a roughly-gridded Australia. And these two look correlated in the logged histogram. Whoop! 
Note: there are some odd values contained within this. E.g. off-coast species occurrences. (Which would thus have a MAP value of 0.) Problems for other days.

The second part of the code is repeating this, sperately, for NATIVE and INTRODUCED POA groups.

What I want to do next: 

- produce dataframe of: grid # | AP | species richness | native richness | introduced richness

- figure out outlier '~0' values

- I am having a little trouble saving the plot of richness x AP.
  + Have got the plots, too, for native and invasive species
