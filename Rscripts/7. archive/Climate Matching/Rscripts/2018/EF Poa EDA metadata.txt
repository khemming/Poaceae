So the paper I am using as a reference for this section ic called: A protocol for data exploration to avoid comon statistical problems (Zuur, Ieno and Elphick, 2010)
& R-help: http://www.statmethods.net/stats/rdiagnostics.html

They identify 7 steps, will go through them accordingly.

1/7: Outliers X and Y



5/7: collinearity. 
Not sure how to caluclate their regression variance equation on page 9, though it does look good. And caluclating these VIFs is something that I should do! 

However, atm, I am going to look at the Pearson correlation coefficient (separate file; ef.ag.df.csv), using the arbitrary cutoffs:
High degree: If the coefficient value lies between ± 0.60 and ± 1, then it is said to be a strong correlation.
Moderate degree: If the value lies between ± 0.30 and ± 0.59, then it is said to be a medium correlation.
Low degree: When the value lies below + .29, then it is said to be a small correlation.
