GBIF data exploration METADATA

v1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this document is to explore the data for explicit use in hSDM modelling exotic grasses of Australia's global and national distributions.

The exploration is defined by explorative steps, similarly to the Rarefaction chapter, investigating in no paticular order:
(1) scale
(2) record distribution 
(3) species richness distribution 
(4) environmental variable (EV) layer correlates
(5) GBIF & EV data cleaning
(6) community make-up (i.e. species-species associations)
