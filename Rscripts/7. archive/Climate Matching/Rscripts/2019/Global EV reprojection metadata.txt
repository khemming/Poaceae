Global reprojection metadata: 25/1/19

The aim of this script is to have the eact same raster formats for all EVs. 

The major thing is replotting their CRS projections. 

All EVs are global in their extents. I think they are all the same in that regard.

The scales are different, and I will tackle that in the coming script, where the scale of this study will depend on the species data. Which I will do now.

So, in short, this script put all teh EVs into one folder (literally the main objective), in the same projection, for use in models later.

Extent: excluding Antarctica; -180, 180, -60, 90
Projection: "+proj=utm +zone=48 +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0"
(Get a reference for why I chose this projection?)
