Distribution fields updated KH METADATA

I manually modified this data based on the following rationale:

(1) The grass study we are doing is not concerned with off-shore islands. Any tags for acronyms that were for islands not contained with the georeference of Australia (i.e. off the coast) were excluded.
Excluded were tags of: ChI, LHI, and Mi [left one 'MDI' as it could be a near-shore or river island].

(2) Any species/tags that may or may not be extinct are not useful for climate matching as extinction could be climatic shifts. Therefore, I excluded all tags with 'extinct' in the title.
