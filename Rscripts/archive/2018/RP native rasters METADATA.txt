RP native single scale rasters METADATA
RP = rarefaction paper

Here I want to segregate 9somehow; not sure how to block yet) my results into easy to manage scripts, for this paper I want to do/chapter I will end up doing, aussi

So far, I have included how to make rasters for 50-, 100- and 200-km scales 
And plotted them
(they're beautiful)

Then I plotted the Human Influence Index, to show the concentration of anthropogenic acitvity (urbanisation, etc.)
